## Solutions to some algorithmic problems

Many of the problems one finds on sites like LeetCode are routine, or 
simply require knowledge of a specific algorithm. But sometimes 
something a bit more unusual may be going on or some 
implementation detail may turn out to be of interest to me.
When this happens I put my solutions here.
